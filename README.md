# Gesture-Based Hand Sign Detection System

## Description
The Gesture-Based Hand Sign Detection System utilizes TensorFlow's Object Detection API and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for real-time hand sign recognition. Integrated with ESP32 for LED feedback, the system enhances user interaction and control.

## Features
- Real-time detection of hand signs using TensorFlow and CNNs
- Integration with Firebase for seamless data communication and storage
- LED feedback system using ESP32 microcontroller for enhanced user interaction
- Comprehensive documentation and usage instructions
